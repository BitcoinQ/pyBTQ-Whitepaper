# pyBTQ-Whitepaper
Bitcoin Quantum (BTQ) is a cryptocurrency designed to offer a secure, sustainable, and scalable currency platform, addressing the issues of security and mining centralization that Bitcoin currently faces. Utilizing quantum-resistant technologies and a long-term emission plan, BTQ aims to ensure safety and stability for the future of cryptocurrency.
BTQ is a state-of-the-art cryptocurrency, blending Bitcoin's trusted economic framework with advanced quantum-resistant security measures. It maintains a total supply of 21 million units, echoing Bitcoinâ€™s limited availability. BTQ differentiates itself by employing a dual-mining approach: it utilizes the CPU-friendly RandomX algorithm and extends support to GPU mining with Cryptonight cn/0. This combination makes mining more inclusive and reduces the risk of hardware centralization. The emission of BTQ is uniquely planned over approximately 1000 years, with a 5% decrease in block rewards every 525,600 blocks, fostering long-term sustainability and market stability. Furthermore, BTQ is advancing its technology with the development of a Proof-of-Stake system, positioning itself to remain resilient and efficient in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology amidst quantum computing developments.
